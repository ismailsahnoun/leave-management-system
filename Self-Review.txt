My suggested improvements are : 

1.Authentication and Authorization:
    - Implementing JWT authentication or integrating with Identity Server
    - Adding role-based authorization (Admin, Manager, Employee)

2.Error Handling: 
    - Add a global exception handling 

3.Unit and Integration Tests:
    - Create unit tests for services and validators
    - Add integration tests for repositories
    - Implement API tests for controllers
    - Set up a CI/CD pipeline with automated testing

4.Performance Optimizations:
    - Implement caching for read-heavy operations
    - Add database indexes for frequently queried fields
